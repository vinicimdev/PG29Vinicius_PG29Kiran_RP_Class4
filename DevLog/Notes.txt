SPENCER ANSWERS

To make money 
Currently: Pitch games to people
Candy crush game, play the game daily to pass the time
Not game intensive like COD
By daily: a limit of how many times per day
Player should play 20-30 mins
Doesnt play games
Untapped market and there needs to be more investment in it
Dont want too immersive (casual not dedicated)
Share score how well u performed (communicate with your friends)
Social connection. More weight if u have buddies :) 
Spices to add to your recipes to get more points
Certain pencils or something
Not really a subscription
Players should feel very engaged but not stressed
Ads -> Just not interrupting but banner ads
